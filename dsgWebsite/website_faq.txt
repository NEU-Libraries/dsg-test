<h3>What is digital scholarship?</h3>
<p>Digital scholarship is a broad term that encompasses a number of scholarly activities that utilize various forms of technology in the digital world. These activities include writing, research, and communications. The purpose of digital scholarship is two-fold: 1) to advance scholarly research through such digital tools and processes as data visualization, network analysis, text-analysis, GIS and mapping, and data-mining and 2) to create an open environment where the knowledge produced using these methods will be accessible to a much larger audience.</p>
